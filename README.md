# Onboarding Project

### Run all Janus Beta tests: 'npx codeceptjs run'
### Run all Webdriver-based tests: 'npx codeceptjs run --grep @Webdriver'
### Run all REST-based tests: 'npx codeceptjs run --grep @REST'
### Run all production safe tests: 'npx codeceptjs run --grep @productionSafe'

## Onboarding Project:
For this project, the AUT is Janus Beta, and runs tests against a specific obituary page in a QA environment. The project is broken up into 6 tasks that challenge me to become more familiar with **CodeceptJS** and **Selenium WebDriver**.
